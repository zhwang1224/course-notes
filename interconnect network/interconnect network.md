      2. processors and mamories(banks)
      3. processors and caches(banks)
      4. caches and caches
      5. IO devices
2. Interconnects Enable Communication 
3. Why is it important?
   1. Affects the scalability and cost of the system
      1. How large of a system can you build?
      2. How easily can you add more processors?
   2. Affects performance and energy efficiency
      1. How fast can processors, caches, and memory communicate?
      2. How long are the latencies to memory?
      3. How much energy is spent on communication?
   3. Affects reliability and security
      1. can you guarantee messages are delivered or your protocol works?
